# File-System

This project models a file system using a ternary (3-child) tree data structure. In most operating systems, files are stored in directories. These directories may contain other directories along with files. In addition to a file system, an OS typically also provides a shell, which is an interface allowing you to run programs and move through the file system. This project will implement a very simple bash shell providing a few very basic functions allowing you to interact with your file system.
